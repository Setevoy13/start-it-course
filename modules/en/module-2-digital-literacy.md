# Module 2. Basic Digital Literacy 💡

**Goal:** feel confident with files, the web, and basic safety. Small steps, clear habits.

---

## 📂 Files & Folders
- A **file** stores information (text, image, program). Examples: `notes.txt`, `photo.jpg`, `script.py`.
- A **folder** (directory) holds files and other folders.
- Common actions: **create**, **rename**, **move**, **delete**.

**Practice:**
1. Create a folder `digital-practice`.
2. Inside it, create `my-first-note.txt` with 2–3 lines about your hobbies.

---

## 🔎 Smart Web Search
Use **keywords**, not long sentences. Add meaningful words.

Examples:
- `install python windows 11`
- `free code editor beginner`
- `python input example`

Try adding **+** to force inclusion: `python +input +integer`.  
Use quotes for exact phrases: `"add python to PATH"`.

**Practice:** search: `best free code editor` and write your choice into `my-first-note.txt`.

---

## ☁️ Cloud & File Sharing
- Cloud tools (Google Drive, Dropbox) help you back up and share files.
- Export to **PDF** before sharing documents for stable formatting.

**Practice:** upload `my-first-note.txt` to your cloud and share a link (optional).

---

## 📧 Email Essentials
- Subject should be short and clear: `Question about Python task`.
- Body: be polite, write 3–5 short sentences, add attachments if needed.

---

## 🔐 Online Safety
1. Use **strong passwords** (12+ chars, mix of letters/numbers/symbols).
2. Turn on **2FA** (two‑factor authentication).
3. Don’t click suspicious links; check the site address.
4. Update your system and browser.

**Practice:** create `safety-rules.txt` with 3 rules you’ll follow.

---

## 📝 Tasks
- Save and organize your files in `digital-practice/`.
- Write down your editor choice (e.g., **VS Code**) and why.
- Create `safety-rules.txt` with 3 rules.

**Example:**
```
My hobby is painting and reading.
Best free code editor: VS Code (extensions, free, popular).
Rules: strong passwords, 2FA, avoid suspicious links.
```

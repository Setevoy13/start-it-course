**Digital literacy** means being confident with computers and the internet.

## 📂 Files and Folders

- A **file** is like a sheet of paper (text, picture, program).
- A **folder** is like a box that holds files.
- Files can have extensions:
  - `.txt` → text file
  - `.jpg` → picture
  - `.py` → Python code

👉 Practice:

1. Create a folder `my_digital_skills`.
2. Inside, create a file `notes.txt` and write: Hello, I am learning IT!
3. Save and close it.

## 🔎 Searching Information

When you don’t know something → **Google it**.  
Examples of useful searches:

- `"How to install Python on Windows"`
- `"Best free text editors"`
- `"Simple Python examples"`

👉 Tip: Use **keywords**, not full sentences.  
Bad: _"I want to learn how I can install python on my windows computer please help"_  
Good: _"Install Python Windows 10"_

# Module 1. What is IT and why do you need it? 💻

Welcome! In this module, you’ll learn what **IT (Information Technology)** is, where it’s used, and which roles exist. You’ll also reflect on your own goals.

---

## 🌍 Where IT is used
- **Everyday life:** smartphones, online maps, banking apps
- **Healthcare:** patient systems, medical imaging, lab software
- **Transport:** ticketing systems, navigation, logistics
- **Education:** e‑learning, online courses, LMS platforms
- **Business:** websites, CRMs, analytics, automation

> IT is not one job — it’s an ecosystem of many roles working together.

---

## 👩‍💻 Common IT roles (beginner-friendly view)
- **Developer (Programmer):** writes code for apps and websites (Python, JavaScript, etc.).
- **QA Tester:** checks software, finds bugs, writes simple test scripts.
- **Data Analyst:** cleans data and finds insights using spreadsheets or Python.
- **System/Cloud Admin:** sets up computers, servers, and cloud services.
- **UI/UX Designer:** designs clear interfaces and user flows.
- **Support/Helpdesk:** helps users solve technical issues.

**Tip:** Beginners often start with **QA**, **support**, or **junior Python/web**.

## 🧠 Myth-busting
- ❌ “IT is only for young people.” → People start at any age.
- ❌ “You need advanced math.” → Logic and practice matter more.
- ❌ “Only geniuses can code.” → Consistency beats talent.
- ❌ “English must be perfect.” → Basic technical English is enough to start.

## 🧩 Mini “day in the life” examples
- **Junior Dev:** fixes a small bug, writes a simple feature, reviews feedback.
- **QA:** follows a checklist, runs the app, reports steps to reproduce a bug.
- **Analyst:** imports CSV into a spreadsheet, builds a chart, explains a trend.

---

## 🛠 Tools you’ll meet in this course
- **Python** (programming language)
- **VS Code** (editor)
- **Terminal/Command Prompt**
- **GitHub** (open repository + certificate automation)

---

## 📝 Tasks
1. In a file `my-it-motivation.txt`, list **3–5 reasons** why you want to learn IT.
2. Pick 1 role (Developer, QA, Analyst, etc.). In 3–5 sentences, write what this person does daily.
3. Optional: search the average salary for juniors in your country and add the source (just a link).

Save the file in a folder `module-1`.
